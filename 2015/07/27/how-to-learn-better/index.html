  <h1 class="post-title">How to Learn Better - The Recall Technique</h1>
  <span class="post-date">27 Jul 2015</span>
  <p>I recently attended the course 
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning how to learn</a>
from
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/ucsd">San Diego university, Californie</a>
on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/courses">Coursera</a>.</p>

<p>I was looking for some tips and tricks to learn better, ie faster and easier.
I learned a lot!</p>

<p>Professors Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski do an excellent job.
I will share with you some things I learned in the course. And I&#39;m going to
start today with the <strong>recall technique</strong>.</p>

<h2>What</h2>

<p>The recall technique is to do a real effort, after a working block, to remember
the main points addressed during this working block.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing more than that, really. But this simple trick is going to boost your
capacity to memorize, by anchoring more deeply all your fresh knowledge into
your memory.</p>

<p>So, what is that thing I called a <strong>working block</strong>? It could be anything:
a 20 minutes class, 30 minutes of reading, a lecture of 45 minutes, an hour
debug session, a 3 hours meeting, etc.</p>

<h2>Why</h2>

<p>If one does nothing to anchor in one&#39;s brain the information learned during a
working block (especially if it was theory), these ones will quickly disappear.
This is a natural phenomenon: the information will be cleared if nothing is done
to retain them.</p>

<p>There is another thing where the recall technique could be of some help: to avoid the illusions of competence (the false sensation to have learned something), focusing on what we have poorly learned.</p>

<h2>How</h2>

<p>The best implementation I have found is to take (no more than) a minute at the
end of a working block to write down the main points. It can be 2 or 3
sentences, a bullet list, a schema, or anything you could think of.</p>

<p>Two remarks: (i) Taking notes during the working block doesn&#39;t exempt you to implement the recall technique, (ii) Thinking about the few main points is not enough, you really have to write them down.</p>

<p><strong>With this very simple habit you really can learn faster and simpler.</strong></p>

<p>See you soon.</p>
