title: How to Learn Better - The Recall Technique
comments: true

I recently attended the course 
[Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
from
[San Diego university, Californie](https://www.coursera.org/ucsd)
on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses).

I was looking for some tips and tricks to learn better, ie faster and easier.
I learned a lot!

Professors Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski do an excellent job.
I will share with you some things I learned in the course. And I'm going to
start today with the **recall technique**.

## What

The recall technique is to do a real effort, after a working block, to remember
the main points addressed during this working block.

It's nothing more than that, really. But this simple trick is going to boost your
capacity to memorize, by anchoring more deeply all your fresh knowledge into
your memory.

So, what is that thing I called a **working block**? It could be anything:
a 20 minutes class, 30 minutes of reading, a lecture of 45 minutes, an hour
debug session, a 3 hours meeting, etc.

## Why

If one does nothing to anchor in one's brain the information learned during a
working block (especially if it was theory), these ones will quickly disappear.
This is a natural phenomenon: the information will be cleared if nothing is done
to retain them.

There is another thing where the recall technique could be of some help: to avoid the illusions of competence (the false sensation to have learned something), focusing on what we have poorly learned.

## How

The best implementation I have found is to take (no more than) a minute at the
end of a working block to write down the main points. It can be 2 or 3
sentences, a bullet list, a schema, or anything you could think of.

Two remarks: (i) Taking notes during the working block doesn't exempt you to implement the recall technique, (ii) Thinking about the few main points is not enough, you really have to write them down.

**With this very simple habit you really can learn faster and simpler.**

See you soon.
