When you are implementing a «well known» algorithm you really should strictly
follow the algorithm's steps as they are.

Do not start to modify this or that part.

Or even worse, do not try to optimize anything.

If it is called a «well known» algorithm, there must a good reason for that.

It's surely that lots and lots of people have run into trouble on this algorithm.

It's likely that an army of developers have worked on it.

Sometimes since 40 years.

A «well known» algorithm is good enough for you.

Implement it as it is.

Save your time.
